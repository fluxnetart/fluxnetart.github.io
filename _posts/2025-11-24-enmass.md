<i>En Masse</i> is an electroacoustic composition for choir and drums which navigates the threads of interconnection among individuals, communities and ecosystems and promotes a culture of care amidst the climate crisis. 

Framed by the carbon cycle, this work is the product of a yearlong <i>flux</i>ART collaboration between multidisciplinary artist <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/Sara/">Sara Bouchard</a> and forest ecologist <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/Sara/">Chris Gough</a>, Professor of Biology at Virginia Commonwealth University.

Inspired by carbon flux research – the “inhalation” and “exhalation” of carbon dioxide in an ecosystem and the teachings of the more-than-human world, <i>En Masse</i> bridges scientific concepts with themes of ritual and imagination and incorporates field recordings, crowd-sourced text and scientific data into the score.

Beginning and ending with the eddies and swirls of the wind, which provide the foundation for carbon flux measurements, <i>En Masse</i>‘s five movements follow the carbon cycle through the elements of air, wood, soil, fire and breath. The piece depicts in turn the voices of migratory songbirds (Air), carbon-absorbing trees (Wood), symbiotic underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi (Soil) and, finally, humans (Fire and Breath). 

Fire amplifies the real-life anxieties of individuals imagining the future of our planet, while a wavering, siren-like melody represents the increase of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, encoded in 16 years of data. Breath pushes beyond fear to focus on meditation practices and suggest a path forward: “Let’s be a forest.” Can we imagine our care systems as complex networks of exchange which shift and pulse in space and time? Can we hold faith that simple, individual interactions can ripple across a community and, en masse, bloom into meaningful change? 

<strong><i>En Masse</i> will be performed by Oregon State University Vocal Ensemble on 22 January, 2026 at the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (PRAx) as part of their arts-science-humanities innaugural celebration.</strong>
