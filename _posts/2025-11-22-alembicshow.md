Come experience ecosystem fluxes and reimagine the infinite interconnections and transformation that sustain life on Earth, opening 19 October, 2025. The Berkeley Alembic hosted a special showcase featuring <i>flux</i>ART works-in-progress including:

* A video installation that explores ecological cycles through color data, offering a dynamic and expansive visual examination of changing landscapes marked by wildfires by Julia Oldham.

* Ecosystem data-viz mandalas that represent the radiant giving and receiving of living soils and plants interacting with climate by Maoya Bassiouni.

* Imaginal meditations that guide people into embodying ecosystem fluxes and dissolving their boundaries with the infinity of nature by Rosa Lewis and collaborators.
