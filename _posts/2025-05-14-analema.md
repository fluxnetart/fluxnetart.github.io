During the September, 2024 Ameriflux conference, fluxART resident Julia Oldham connected with Dr. Dave Bowling (University of Utah) while presenting video work in a poster session. Dr. <a href = "https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u0188537"> David Bowling</a> and Dr. <a href="https://richardson-lab.nau.edu/">Andrew Richardson</a> (Northern Arizona University) were interested in tracking an analemma shape using <a href = "https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/">PhenoCam imagery</a>, and invited Julia to help with the project. An <a href ="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250102.html"> analemma</a> is a figure eight shape that can be observed by photographing the sun from the exact same location at the exact same time every day for a year. The inverse of this shape can be observed by tracing a shadow in the same way.

“<i>I pored over thousands of PhenoCam photos, looking for a site where I could identify a shadow that stayed in the image frame all year long. With guidance from Dr. Richardson about what types of sites might be most useful to examine, I discovered a shadow that I could trace throughout the year at the Southwest Experimental Garden Array in Flagstaff, AZ (segaarboretum10). After compiling a 9:30 AM timelapse video of one year of Phenocam images, I hand-traced the shadow using animation software and my drawing tablet to visualize the analemma. To create sound for the video, I sonified a drawing of all of the points that made up the analemma shape.</i> –  Julia Oldham
