In April 2025, artist <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/Julia/">Julia Oldham</a> was invited by Prof. <a href="https://richardson-lab.nau.edu/">Andrew Richardson</a> to give a talk in the Ecoinformatics Lecture series at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff. Julia had the chance to share her artistic works and creative approach, as well as engage in discussions about a wide range of ecosystem science topics with faculty and students.

“<i>I knew that Julia had been working a bit with PhenoCam images from several different sites, but until she gave her presentation and showed some of her work, I really had no idea just how creatively and imaginatively she was using these photographs in her art. I always knew that there had to be so many different ways PhenoCam images could be used for different applications, but I never quite expected to see the kinds of things Julia has been working on.</i>

<i>What I really found interesting about Julia’s work is that she’s not using art as a tool for science communication, which I think is what we often think of when we think of the intersection of science and art. Instead, she is actually creating art from raw scientific documents - the high-frequency PhenoCam images, snapshots of what an ecosystem looked like at a particular point in space and time - and through processing and manipulation turning those digital image files into something new and different, giving us an entirely new perspective on the world around us." </i> –  <a href="https://richardson-lab.nau.edu/">Andrew Richardson</a>
