What does it feel like to dissolve your experience into the fluxes, cycles and interconnections that sustain all life on Earth? What if embodying the experience of a microbe in the carbon cycle or a cloud in the water cycle was a pathway to experiencing Buddha Nature?

<a href = "https://biosphere-breath.github.io/">Breathing as the Biosphere</a> is a collection of imaginal meditations that invite you to dissolve your boundaries with the infinity of nature. By embodying the Biosphere's breath, you are guided to journey, feel, and reimagine your relationship with the living world. 

This <i>flux</i>ART collaboration between artist <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/Rosa/">Rosa Lewis</a> and research scientist <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/Rosa/">Maoya Bassiouni </a>is an ongoing project that you can follow on <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/show/1525pYDIu4DT1MLiY2pbVd">Spotify</a> and on the Breathing as the Biosphere <a href = "https://biosphere-breath.github.io/">website</a>. 

Using the metaphors of the biosphere’s breath as imaginal doorways into the depths of experience, the embodied imaginal journeys seek to awaken a sense of interdependence, fundamental goodness and empowerment, even in the face of fear, ecosystem grief, or other challenging emotions. May you experience the awe, nourishment and love that arise from your interconnection with ecosystem energy, water, and carbon fluxes.

The project features selected guided meditations and imaginal journeys developed collaboratively and iteratively through conversations and experimentations between creative, contemplative practitioners and ecosystem scientists, exploring at each step areas of overlap between Buddha Nature and Earth system processes in flux as imaginal somatic experiences, individually as well as in collective attunement.

The collection of guided meditations offer insights into how directly experiencing and embracing the ever-changing nature of ecosystems can create a sense of belonging and peace.

  Rosa Lewis brings you into the imaginal experience of becoming the soil and sensing the intricate web of life below ground. Through embodied awareness, you explore the textures, cycles, and interconnections of minerals, organic matter, air, water, and living organisms, uncovering the soil’s inner flux and renewal as a mirror for your own Buddha nature. <br>
