Your voice can become part of a fluxART composition!

Inspired by the carbon cycle, "En Masse" is an electroacoustic composition for 12-voice choir and percussion, weaving together science, data and personal reflection, created by composer and artist in residence <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/Sara">Sara Bouchard</a> with collaborator Chris Gough.

Please take a moment to share your thoughts in this <a href = "https://tinyurl.com/5dhyedyy">questionnaire</a> and Sara will weave your responses in the choir's libretto.


Thank you for your help shaping this unique musical work with perspectives across the network!
