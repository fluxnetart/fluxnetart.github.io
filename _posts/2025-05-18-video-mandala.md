The ‘Breathing as the Bisophere’ project is creating guided imaginal meditations and media content that offer insights into how directly experiencing and embracing the ever-changing nature of ecosystems can create a sense of belonging and peace – we are all an expression of nature in its constant change. This project aims to empower people to feel a sense of beauty, nourishment and love by embodying the biosphere’s breath and contemplating their interconnection with ecosystem energy, water, and carbon fluxes. 

As part of the project, we are creating a video mandala by collating clips of people, in locations around the world, connecting with nature in contemplative ways. We would be delighted to include <a href = "https://bit.ly/fluxart-submit-video-mandala">your submissions!</a>

<h4>We are inviting everyone to embrace the feeling of being a part of the biosphere.</h4>

Individually and collectively stitching together moments of presence and connection to ecosystems can create a quiet revolution that both inspires and resources people. 

We invite you to connect to nature in a contemplative way and capture a short video clip of your experience to submit to the project. Your contemplation could be a walk, a sitting meditation or something more interactive. It could include some singing, spoken words, the sounds of nature, or be in silence. The purpose is for you to be present and feel a sense of belonging in the biosphere, in a way that is supportive, evocative, playful or inspiring for you in some way. <b>We look forward to receiving your <a href = "https://bit.ly/fluxart-submit-video-mandala">submissions at this link</a>, see video specs below.</b> 

We’d also like to invite you to feel the full range of your emotional experience. To support you with this, you can tune into the vastness of nature and its capacity to meet you in any form of expression in the present moment. Meeting and being met by nature in its constant state of flux opens up the possibility for a deep sense of resonance and radical acceptance, where the full range of experience can flow more freely. <b>Try the short reflection exercise we offer below.</b>

“<i>There are many ways of understanding what reality is and some ways of experiencing the Universe have the potential to open up both more aliveness and more peace. Experiencing yourself as an intrinsic part of the unfolding Universe, and feeling the benevolence and beauty in that unfolding, is a way of feeling nourished and supported, while also expanding your remit of care towards the worlds and others.” </i> – Rosa Lewis

<h4>Reflection Exercise</h4>

You can either do this reflection exercise while you are out in nature or imagine a specific moment in time when you have felt most connected to nature.

1. Set a timer for 2 mins, then write a list of all the best things you feel from this connection to nature. Don’t filter, just let it flow. The timer is to help you avoid overthinking.
2. Set another two minute timer, this time list some emotions or experiences that feel like they are usually hard for you to feel or acknowledge. These could be any type of thoughts, energies or emotions. They could be positive or negative. Again, don’t overthink, just let it all flow.
3. Feel into the vastness and beauty of the nature that you are connected to. Notice the ways that the ecosystem around you is always in an exchange of giving and receiving and a constant state of flux. Imagine that nature is there to support you with the thing you find challenging. What would it offer to you to allow things to flow more freely and lovingly?
4. Set a final two minute timer. Describe what you think the Universe is and how you fit into it. There is no right or wrong answer, just let yourself express what feels most resonant to you in this moment.
