Meet the <i>flux</i>ART collaborations and join us at the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (PRAx) on 22 January, 2026 for the opening celebration of a special art-science showcase featuring projects from the <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/artists/">2024-25 FLUXNET artists-in-residence cohort</a>. 

This special evening will offer the opportunity to also explore artworks from international art-science programs including the <a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/initiatives/ll-stewart-fellowship/2024-awardees">PRAx Collaborative Faculty Fellowship</a> from Oregon State University, <a href = "climatewhirl.fi/en">Climate Whirl</a> and <a href = "https://www.periferia.helsinki.fi/">Periferia Forest Art Lab</a> from Finland, and the <a href = "https://itoc.alaska.edu/">In a Time of Change</a> program from Alaska. The event will also feature talks from each program and a <i>flux</i>ART musical performance. 

Come experience ecosystem fluxes and reimagine the infinite interconnections that sustain life on Earth.
Together we will explore how artistic inquiry can transform flux science and how scientific curiosity fosters artistic creativity.
