What would we learn and experience if we attuned ourselves to the world with the open heart of an artist and restless curiosity of a scientist?

Artist <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/Sara/">Sara Bouchard</a> and ecologist <a href = "https://www.goughlab.com/">Chris Gough</a> visited the Rice Rivers Center at Virginia Commonweath University to record the inside of a tree. They placed a probe in the tree xylem, the plant tissue that carries water and minerals from roots up through the stem and to the leaves.


Sara's creative journey with sonification arouse from “seeing sound” in the environment around her. Her experiments with science and sound includes analyzing data by hand to leveraging environmental sensors and live coding for real-time interactive experiences. Sara’s work, rooted in environmental data, demonstrates how sonification can foster emotional resonance and community connection, helping people not only understand but truly feel the story of our landscapes.


Chris studies how disturbance, succession, and climate change shape carbon cycling and ecosystem structure in forests and wetlands. A major effort in his research lab is monitoring tidal wetlands in the <a href = "https://ricerivers.vcu.edu/research-and-restoration/wetlands/emerging-technologies/">Rice Rivers Center</a> to investigate the controls on both carbon dioxide uptake and methane emissions.
