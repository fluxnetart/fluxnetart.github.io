<h4>Artist Bio</h4>

<a href="https://www.sarabouchard.com"><b>Sara Bouchard</b></a> is a multidisciplinary artist and composer who uses sound, performance, installation, creative coding and works on paper to interweave song, story and the landscape. Sara’s collaborations with the environment have included data sonifications, sensor-driven soundscapes and musical improvisations with organic materials. Sara has exhibited and performed internationally, including at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (CT), The Center for Book Arts (NYC), ERES Foundation (Munich, Germany) and the International Conference for Live Coding (Utrecht, Netherlands). Born in Stockton, CA, Sara received her BA from Yale University in 2003 and her MFA from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2019. She currently teaches at VCUarts Department of Kinetic Imaging.

<h4>Science Collaboration</h4>

Research in the <a href="https://www.goughlab.com/">Gough lab</a> focuses on how disturbance, succession, and climate change shape carbon cycling and ecosystem structure in forests and wetlands. This research includes using large-scale field experiments, remote sensing, and modeling to study for example how forest ages affect carbon sequestration and why older forests can sustain high carbon uptake. A major effort in the Gough’s research group is collecting long-term carbon flux data from Ameriflux Core Sites at the University of Michigan Biological Station to support global modeling efforts, and as well as monitoring tidal wetlands in the Rice Rivers Center to investigate the controls on both carbon dioxide uptake and methane emissions.
