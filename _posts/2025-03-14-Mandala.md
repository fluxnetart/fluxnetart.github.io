title: Ecosystem Flux Mandalas
excerpt: Maoya Bassiouni visualizes observations from >500 global ecosystems that capture how complex interactions create emergent patterns that have unity
categories: projects

 Eddy-covariance flux towers measure carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy exchanges between ecosystems and the atmosphere, allowing us to observe the breathing of soils and plants interacting with climate, a constant giving and receiving that sustains life on Earth. Maoya Bassiouni transformed data from >500 global ecosystems into visualizations that represents the unique pattern of productivity, water, and meteorological seasonal cycles at eddy-covariance research tower sites, from dryland tropical forests in Australia, alpine grasslands in Switzerland, croplands in the Midwest USA, wetlands in Greenland and many more.

Ecosystem daily flux mandalas illustrate how complex interactions create emergent patterns that have unity. Try connecting with the wholeness of the ecosystem encoded in these mandalas. Can you feel all the tiny interactions that lead to its emergence and how much precision and exchange goes into that creative process?

Ecosystem seasonal flux mandalas symbolize the unity in the Earth system as a gateway to awaken our true nature. They invites us to look at the full spectrum of experience and welcome it with the curiosity of a scientist and the open heart of compassion.

  <figcaption>Ecosystem daily flux mandalas represents daily time series along co-centric circles. Ecosystem and meteorological variables from the outer to inner circle are carbon sequestration (net ecosystem exchange), ecosystem photosynthesis (gross primary productivity), ecosystem respiration (heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration), ecosystem evapotranspiration (latent heat flux), land-atmosphere temperature exchange (sensible heat flux), sunlight (shortwave radiation), air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Peaks indicate the growing season and dips the dormant season, repeating for each year of record and showing year-to-year variability in ecosystem functioning and climate. </figcaption>

  <figcaption>Ecosystem seasonal flux mandalas represents daily seasonal cycles averaged and repeated along co-centric circles. Variables from outer to inner circle are atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, air temperature, land-atmosphere temperature exchange (sensible heat flux), ecosystem evapotranspiration (latent heat flux), sunlight (shortwave radiation), carbon sequestration (net ecosystem exchange), ecosystem photosynthesis (gross primary productivity), ecosystem respiration (heterotrophic plus autotrophic respiration), and atmospheric CO2 concentration. </figcaption>
