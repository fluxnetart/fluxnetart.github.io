Flux Mandalas, data visualizations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes and meteorological variables from FLUXNET ecosystems represents the unique pattern of productivity, water, and meteorological seasonal cycles at eddy-covariance research tower sites, from dryland tropical forests in Australia, alpine grasslands in Switzerland, croplands in the Midwest USA, wetlands in Greenland and many more.

“<i>Eddy-covariance flux towers measure carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy exchanges between ecosystems and the atmosphere and allow us observe the radiant soul of living soils and plants interacting with climate and co-creating the atmosphere. A constant giving and receiving that sustains life on Earth and brings us together. </i> –  <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/David/">Maoya Bassiouni</a>
