<h4>Bio</h4>

Working in a range of digital media, <b><a href="https://www.juliaoldham.com/">Julia Oldham</a></b> visualizes the uneasy collision of nature and technology in a fragile world. She documents extant environments such as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, clear cut forests in Oregon, and swaths of derelict wilderness in New York City, and she also builds fictional worlds through drawing and animation. With tenderness and humor, Oldham explores her own conflicting feelings about human progress through her narrative works, envisioning speculative futures and exploring scientific history. The final works take the form of short films, video installations and print projects. Her practice is research intensive, frequently involving scientists as collaborators.
