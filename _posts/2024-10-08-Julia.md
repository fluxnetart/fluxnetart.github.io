<h4>Project</h4>

<b>FLUX</b> is a multi-channel video installation that explores ecological cycles through color data using a range of lens-based technologies. By transforming scientific imagery and field data into immersive visual experiences, <b><a href="https://www.juliaoldham.com/">Julia Oldham</a></b>’s artwork offers a dynamic and expansive visual examination of changing landscapes in the Pacific Northwest USA.


<h4>Artist Bio</h4>

<b><a href="https://www.juliaoldham.com/">Julia Oldham</a></b> is a digital media artist with a research intensive practice, frequently involving scientists as collaborators. She visualizes the uneasy collision of nature and technology in a fragile world. She documents extant environments such as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, clear cut forests in Oregon, and swaths of derelict wilderness in New York City. She also builds fictional worlds through drawing and animation. With tenderness and humor, Julia explores her own conflicting feelings about human progress through her narrative works, envisioning speculative futures and exploring scientific history.

<h4>Science Collaboration</h4>

Research in the <b><a href="https://directory.forestry.oregonstate.edu/people/still-chris">Still lab</a></b> focuses on the physiological responses of forests and grasslands to seasonal and interannual weather variation and ongoing climate change, along with resulting impacts of those changes on carbon and water cycling. This research is conducted at different space scales, from plants to ecosystems, and combines measurements with remote sensing and process modeling. A major effort of Still’s research group is running the Metolius site cluster. These sites span a range of forest ages and sizes as well as disturbance history from fire and logging and are located along one of the steepest precipitation gradients in North America from the Cascade crest eastward to the Oregon high desert. Research at these sites includes eddy covariance-based measurement of carbon, water, and energy exchanges, as well as monitoring tree water fluxes using sap flow sensors, soil carbon fluxes using chambers, as well canopy temperature, structure and functioning with various imagers.
