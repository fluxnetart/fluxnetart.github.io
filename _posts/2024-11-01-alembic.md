In September, Maoya demoed the Dyantra software developed in collaboration with artist David Glowacki bringing it to life with data from the Mayberry restored wetland flux tower in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. She created "Tonglen with the Biosphere’s Breath" for the Berkeley Alembic Equinox event, an installation and visual mediation of ecosystem-atmosphere interactions. The installation invites partipants to practice disolving boundaries and exchanging self with other.
