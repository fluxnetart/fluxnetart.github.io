You’re invited for a special art-science showcase 22-23 January, 2026 at the Patricia Valian Reser Center for the Creative Art (<a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/">PRAx</a>), Oregon State University, Corvallis OR. 

This event includes an evening art opening reception, featuring several international art-science collaborations and performances, as well as intimate fluxART activities and conversations with <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/artists/">FLUXNET artists in residence</a>. Together we will explore how artistic inquiry can transform flux science and vice versa how scientific curiosity fosters artistic creativity. <strong>Come experience ecosystem fluxes and reimagine the infinite interconnections that sustain life on Earth.</strong>
