<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere, they are tracking the biosphere's breath. 

 <a href = "https://fluxnetart.github.io/"><i>flux</i><b>Art</b></a> collaborations use creative inquiry to explore and experience how unexpected beauty can emerge from the concept of <i>flux</i> and transform our relationship with the biosphere, the infinite interconnections that sustain life on Earth. 

 In partnership with the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (<a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/">PRAx</a>), we are delighted to present the <i>flux</i><b>Art</b> exhibit and symposium, opening 22 January 2026 in Corvallis OR.
