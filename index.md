<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere, they are tracking the biosphere's breath. 

 <i>flux</i><b>Art</b>, our artist in residence program, aims to contemplate environmental change, both to illuminate flux science in the general public’s imagination and to strengthen communication between academics and society toward more actionable research. 

<i>flux</i><b>Art</b> is supported by the National Science Foundation’s Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations program (NSF AccelNet Award 2113978) and partnered with the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (<a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/">PRAx</a>).
