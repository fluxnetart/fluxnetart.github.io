<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between ecosystems and atmosphere, they are tracking the biosphere's breath. 

 <i>flux</i>ART collaborations use creative inquiry to explore how unexpected beauty can emerge from the concept of <i>flux</i> and transform our relationship with environmental change and the often invisible processes and interactions that sustain life on Earth – turning flux science into stories and embodied experiences of nature’s resilience.

Projects emerging from this exchange will be showcased from 22 January to 7 March 2026 at the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (PRAx) in the exhibition <a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/visual-arts/currents-experiments-art-science-collaboration"><i>Currents: Experiments in Art-Science Collaboration</i></a>. Meet the artists and join us at PRAx on 22 January, 2026 for the opening celebration and <i>En Masse</i> musical performance. <a href="https://prax.oregonstate.edu/events/opening-celebration-currents-experiments-art-science-collaboration">Event info and ticketing</a>
