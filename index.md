<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere, they are tracking the biosphere's breath. 

 <i>flux</i><b>Art</b> collaborations use creative inquiry to explore and experience how unexpected beauty can emerge from the concept of <i>flux</i> and transform our relationship with the biosphere, the infinite interconnections that sustain life on Earth. 

This pilot artist in residence program is supported by the National Science Foundationâ€™s Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations program (NSF AccelNet Award 2113978) and partnered with the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (<a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/">PRAx</a>), which will host a <i>flux</i><b>Art</b> exhibit and symposium in January 2026.
