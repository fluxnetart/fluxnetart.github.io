<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere, they are tracking the biosphere's breath. 

 <i>flux</i>ART collaborations use creative inquiry to explore and experience how unexpected beauty can emerge from the concept of <i>flux</i> and transform our relationship with the biosphere, the infinite interconnections that sustain life on Earth. 

<i>flux</i>ART projects will be showcased from 22 January to 7 March 2026 at the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (PRAx) in the exhibition <a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/visual-arts/currents-experiments-art-science-collaboration"><i>Currents: Experiments in Art-Science Collaboration</i></a>.
